# Supervised-learning
supervised learning using various supervised models and algorithms with different datasets

## Algorithms:
- I've used various algorithms including Support vector classifier,Naivebayes and Decision tree algorithms

## Datasets:
- I've used the famous dataset named Iris dataset and also used make moonds dataset



## Graph plots
